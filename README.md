A fully parameterized and generic Verilog implementation of the suggested modular SRAM-based indirectly-indexed hierarchical-search TCAM (IITCAM), together with other approaches are provided as open source hardware. A run-in-batch flow manager to simulate and synthesize different designs with various parameters in batch using Altera's ModelSim and Quartus is also provided.
