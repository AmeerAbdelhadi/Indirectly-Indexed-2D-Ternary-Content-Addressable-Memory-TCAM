        Indirectly-indexed TCAM (IITCAM); University of British Columbia, 2016
      Author: Ameer M.S. Abdelhadi (ameer@ece.ubc.ca, ameer.abdelhadi@gmail.com)

  A fully parameterized and generic Verilog implementation of  the  suggested modular
  SRAM-based indirectly-indexed hierarchical-search  TCAM ( IITCAM ),  together  with
  other approaches are provided as open source hardware. A run-in-batch flow  manager
  to simulate and synthesize different designs with various parameters in batch using
  Altera's ModelSim and Quartus is also provided.
